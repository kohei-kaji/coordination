## Requirements
We used `Python==3.11.2`.

Additionally, download the following repositories:
- [artificial languages](https://github.com/rycolab/artificial-languages) ([White and Cotterell, 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.38/))
- [rnng-pytorch](https://github.com/aistairc/rnng-pytorch) ([Noji and Oseki, 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.380/))
    - Note:\
    You need to modify a few files in the `rnng-pytorch` repository as described in `src/rnng-pytorch_/README.md`.
    The modified versions of these files are in the `src/rnng-pytorch_` directory.
    Please replace the corresponding files in the `rnng-pytorch` repository with these modified files.\
    Ryo Yoshida (p.c.) provided me the code for calculating the logliks of each parse. Thanks Ryo!


The data and results we used are available as zip files at [this google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12mRPlKXXQKueYbITQYDkeRKlHvyMrS8T?usp=sharing).
